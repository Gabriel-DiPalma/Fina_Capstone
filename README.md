Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 1)
                                                    Innova Gym

  If you're not moving in the workplace, you're putting yourself at risk for obesity and heart disease, according to scientific research. So, you've made that annual resolution to work-out and drop a few pounds. But buying a T-shirt and sneakers is just not enough these days. 
according to CNET one of the top issues at CES 2020 will be Health and wellness. Once scattered across the sea of different pavilions at CES, this category now takes up nearly half of Tech West -- where most of the newest and most innovative vendors make their pitch. It features technology to help you eat better, sleep better, exercise more efficiently, monitor your health better and a ton of other new takes on health and wellness. There are bands that claim to track how many calories you take in (rather than logging your meals) and mini bikes to help kids stay fit while playing video games.  But all this "new techs" dosnÂ´t really solve all the problems. None of this techs can replace a real gym. So the challenge remains. 

  Thats the ideia behind Inova gym, a fully wereable integrated gym near the most up trandings fitness restaurants. Fully helping your calorie intake and spending goals.
  
  In order to base and increase the assertiveness of the Inova Gym location choice, the foursquare dataset was used. Toronto's neighborhoods were ranked by the presence of health food and fast food restaurants. Each health food restaurant added two points to the neighborhood and each fast food restaurant subtracted one point from the sum. Than a chart was made with the ranked neighborhoods.
